# External Services

External services add extra features and tools to your OpenRemote system. They appear as new sections in the Manager UI, giving you access to additional capabilities like AI assistants, analytics dashboards, or custom tools that your administrator has set up.

When you click on an external service, it opens right within OpenRemote just like any other page, so you don't need to switch between different applications.

## What are External Services?

External services are additional applications that work alongside OpenRemote. You'll see them as new menu items or sections in your Manager UI. Each service provides different functionality, such as AI assistants, analytics dashboards, device management tools, or custom integrations.

When you use an external service, it looks and feels like part of OpenRemote, but it's actually a separate application that's been integrated for you.

## Finding External Services

### Where to Look

External services can appear in several places in the Manager UI:

1. **Main Menu** - Look for the `Services` menu item, this will show all services available to you

### Service Status

You can see if a service is working properly by looking at its status icon on the right side of the service name:

- **Available** - The icon will be a simple play icon
- **Unavailable** - The icon will be a red hexagon with an X, indicating that the service is unavailable

If you see a service marked as unavailable, it might be updating or experiencing temporary issues. Try refreshing your browser or check back in a few minutes.

## Using External Services

### Opening a Service

To use an external service:

1. **Click** on the service name in your navigation menu
2. **Wait** for the service interface to load within OpenRemote
3. **Use** the service just like you would use any web application

The service will open in the same browser window, but you'll see its own interface and controls.

## Types of Services

You might encounter two types of external services:

### Organization-wide Services
- Available to **everyone** in your organization, across all realms
- Usually managed by your IT department or system administrators
- Examples: Company-wide analytics, centralized AI tools

### Realm-specific Services
- Only available within **your specific realm** or project
- Configured for your particular use case
- Examples: Project-specific dashboards, local integrations

You don't need to worry about which type a service is - if you can see it in your menu, you can use it.

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Load

If an external service isn't working:

1. **Check the status** - Is it showing as "Available"?
2. **Refresh your browser** - Press F5 or click the refresh button
3. **Clear your browser cache** - This can solve many loading issues
4. **Check your internet connection** - External services may need internet access
5. **Try a different browser** - Sometimes browser compatibility can cause issues

### Can't Access a Service

If you can see a service but can't use it:

- **Check with your administrator** - You might need additional permissions
- **Verify your permissions** - Different user roles have access to different services

### Getting Help

When you encounter problems:

1. **Note the error message** - Write down exactly what you see
2. **Try the basic troubleshooting steps** above
3. **Contact your system administrator** with details about the problem
4. **Include screenshots** if possible - they help explain the issue

## Adding New Services

Adding new services is done by your administrator. They can add any existing service that may already be available, or they can create a new service.

If you need additional functionality that isn't currently available, contact your administrator to discuss what options might be available.

## Summary

External services expand what you can do with OpenRemote by adding specialized tools and features. They appear right in your Manager UI, so you can access everything from one place.

If you see new menu items or sections that weren't there before, those are likely external services that have been added to enhance your system. Don't hesitate to explore them or ask your administrator about what's available - they're there to make your work easier and more effective.
