# Services

Services are additional applications that work alongside OpenRemote to add extra features and tools to your system. You'll see them as entries in the `Services` page in your Manager UI, giving you access to additional functionality like AI assistants, forecasting, device management tools, or custom integrations.

When you select a service, it opens right within OpenRemote just like any other page.

## Finding and Using Services

### Where to Look

You can find all services available to you in the `Services` page of the Manager UI.

### Service Status

You can see if a service is working properly by looking at its status icon on the right side of the service name:

- **Available** - The icon will be a simple play icon
- **Unavailable** - The icon will be a red hexagon with an X, indicating that the service is unavailable

If you see a service marked as unavailable, it might be updating or experiencing temporary issues. Try refreshing your browser or check back in a few minutes.

### Opening a Service

To use a service:

1. **Click** on the service name in the `Services` page
2. **Wait** for the service interface to load within OpenRemote
3. **Use** the service just like you would use any other part of OpenRemote

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Load

If a service isn't working:

1. **Check the status** - Is it showing as "Available"?
2. **Refresh your browser** - Press F5 or click the refresh button
3. **Clear your browser cache** - This can solve many loading issues
4. **Check your internet connection** - Services may need internet access
5. **Try a different browser** - Sometimes browser compatibility can cause issues

### Can't Access a Service

If you can see a service but can't use it:

- **Check with your administrator** - You might need additional permissions
- **Verify your permissions** - Different user roles have access to different services

### Getting Help

When you encounter problems:

1. **Note the error message** - Write down exactly what you see
2. **Try the basic troubleshooting steps** above
3. **Contact your system administrator** with details about the problem
4. **Include screenshots** if possible, they help explain the issue

## Adding New Services

Adding new services is done by your administrator. They can add any existing service that may already be available, or they can create a new service.

If you need additional functionality that isn't currently available, contact your administrator to discuss what options might be available.

## Summary

Services expand what you can do with OpenRemote by adding specialized tools and features. They appear right in your Manager UI, so you can access everything from one place.

Don't hesitate to explore them or ask your administrator about what's available. They're there to provide you with additional tools and features.
