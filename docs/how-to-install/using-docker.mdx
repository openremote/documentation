# Install using Docker

The most common installation method for OpenRemote is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com).<br />
It is the most popular tool for providing containerization, which runs our software in its own isolated environment.<br />

We provide easy-to-install configurations using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) profiles.<br />
All of our distributions, for both ARM64 and AMD64, are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openremote).<br />

## Prerequisites

<CardElement prefix={DockerIcon} suffix={OpenInTabIcon} url="https://www.docker.com">
    <span>Install Docker Engine</span>
    <span>Version 18 or higher</span>
</CardElement>
<br />
You'll need access to the Docker CLI during the setup, to start containers using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).<br />

{/*<Tabs queryString="prerequisites">
    <TabItem value="desktop" label="Using desktop environment" default attributes={{className: [styles.menu_item, styles.menu_item_desktop]}}>
        - **Install Docker Desktop**<br />
        You can install Docker Desktop on [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/), [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/) or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/).<br />
        It provides a straightforward GUI (Graphical User Interface) that lets you manage your containers, applications,<br />
        and images directly from your machine. All necessary tools for installing OpenRemote come preinstalled.

    <TabItem value="command-line" label="Using command line" attributes={{className: [styles.menu_item, styles.menu_item_commandline]}}>
        - **Install Docker Engine for Linux**<br />
        Users can install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on any Linux distribution for running OpenRemote.<br />
        It includes all necessary CLI tools (like Docker Compose) for a smooth installation process.<br />
        Other platforms will have to use the [desktop environment](./using-docker?prerequisites=desktop) instead.

## Installing OpenRemote

Depending on your project, and the amount of customization you need, we provide steps below.

<Tabs queryString="install">
    <TabItem value="demo" label="Demo version" default attributes={{className: [styles.menu_item, styles.menu_item_demoversion]}}>
        <img src={OpenRemoteDemo} alt="OpenRemote Demo" className={styles.image} />
        *Figure 1. Screenshot of the Manager UI Map page filled with the assets of this setup.*

        We distribute a demo version of OpenRemote that includes several assets with simulated data.<br />
        It includes automation rules, dashboards, and full administrator control of the software.<br />
        The easy setup allows users to discover platform features, without needing additional setup.<br />
        <br />

        ### 1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file
        <CardElement prefix={DockerIcon} suffix={DownloadIcon} url="https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/1.3.0/docker-compose.yml">
            <span>docker-compose.yml</span>
        </CardElement>
        <br />
        By default, we expose port `80` (HTTP), `443` (HTTPS) and `8883` (MQTT) to the local network.<br />
        Make sure the correct firewall routing is set up for public access on these ports.<br />
        Alternatively, you can adjust port mapping within the `docker-compose.yml` file; see [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/networking/).<br />
        <br />

        ### 2. Start the OpenRemote stack
        Open a terminal in the folder you downloaded the `docker-compose.yml` file in, and run the following command;
        ```bash
        docker-compose -p openremote up -d
        ```
        <br />

        ### Complete!
        You can now visit the Manager UI on **https://localhost**, and log in with username `admin`, and password `secret`.<br />

        <Admonition type="note" title="Did an 'Your connection is not private' error appear?">
            It is referring to an self-signed SSL certificate that needs to be accepted, as we're running a local demo version.<br />
            You can bypass this error, see more information on this [here](https://www.guidingtech.com/top-ways-to-fix-your-connection-is-not-private-in-chrome/).

            For a production deployment, with an SSL certificate, check the [production guide](./using-docker?install=production)
        </Admonition>
        <br />

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="production" label="Production ready" attributes={{className: [styles.menu_item, styles.menu_item_productionready]}}>
        <img src={InsightsDashboard} alt="OpenRemote Production demo" className={styles.image} />
        *Figure 2. Screenshot of the Manager UI Insights page filled with simulated data.*

        This guide will help you setting up a production-ready OpenRemote instance, together with an included proxy service.<br />
        It comes without any pre-installed assets or realms, and includes minor tweaks to optimize for production use.<br />
        <br />

        ### 1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file
        <CardElement prefix={DockerIcon} suffix={DownloadIcon} url="https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/1.3.0/docker-compose.yml">
            <span>docker-compose.yml</span>
        </CardElement>
        <br />
        By default, we expose port `80` (HTTP), `443` (HTTPS) and `8883` (MQTT) to the local network.<br />
        Make sure the correct firewall routing is set up for public access on these ports.<br />
        Alternatively, you can adjust port mapping within the `docker-compose.yml` file; see [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/networking/).<br />
        <br />

        ### 2. Create an `.env` file in the same folder
        You can configure the OpenRemote instance using environment variables.<br />
        We create an `.env` file, where we add variables in `ENV_VARIABLE=VALUE` format. See this example here;
        ```env
        OR_HOSTNAME=demo.openremote.app
        OR_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret
        ```
        The most common environment variables are:
        - `OR_HOSTNAME` - Configures the accessible hostname URL for all services.
        - `OR_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Sets the initial password for the `admin` username.
        - `OR_EMAIL_***` - Configures the mail server to send emails from; full list [here](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/1.3.0/profile/deploy.yml#L172).
        - `OR_ADDITIONAL_HOSTNAMES` - Allow additional hostname URLs on top of `OR_HOSTNAME`.

        A full list of variables can be viewed [here](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/1.3.0/profile/deploy.yml).<br />
        <br />

        ### 3. Optional steps
        <details>
            <summary>Configure a wildcard SSL certificate for your custom domain</summary>

            By default, we ship a self-signed SSL certificate based on the `OR_HOSTNAME` environment variable.<br />
            You can bring your own by including the full certificate chain in a `.pem` file.<br />

            Place your `.pem` file in the same folder as your `docker-compose.yml` is located.<br />

            After that, you need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file, to include the following line;
            ```yml
            services:
              proxy:
                 image: openremote/proxy:${PROXY_VERSION:-latest}
                 // ...
                 volumes:
                 - proxy-data:/deployment
                 - ./cert.pem:/etc/haproxy/certs/00-custom
            ```
        </details>
        <br />

        ### 4. Start the OpenRemote stack
        Open a terminal in the same folder, and run the following command;
        ```bash
        docker-compose -p openremote up -d
        ```
        <br />

        ### Complete!
        You can now visit the Manager UI on **https://[yourhostname].com**, and log in with username `admin`, and your password.<br />
        <br />

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="custom-project" label="Using a Custom Project" attributes={{className: [styles.menu_item, styles.menu_item_customproject]}}>
        Work in progress
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Frequently asked questions
<details>
    <summary>**Error:** "We are sorry... Invalid parameter: redirect_uri"</summary>

    This is a common error when using an unexpected URL to access the Manager.<br />
    By default, only `localhost` is accepted, and other hostnames are rejected from access.<br />

    You can use the `OR_HOSTNAME` and `OR_ADDITIONAL_HOSTNAMES` environment variables for this.<br />
    Check Step 2 of the [Production ready guide](./using-docker?install=production#2-create-an-env-file-in-the-same-folder) for more details on setting these up.
