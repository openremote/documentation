# Manager APIs

The OpenRemote Manager API is composed of the following APIs, each API requires authentication (with the exception of `read`/`write` of public `asset` `attributes` see [Asset security](identity-and-security/asset-security.md)).

To be able to authenticate you'll need to create a service user using the Manager UI (must be logged in as super user to access this functionality), please refer to the Manager UI user guide; access tokens can be obtained from the token endpoint using standard OAuth 2.0 techniques.

* OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint: `/auth/realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token`
* Regular user supported grant type(s): `authorizationCode`
* Service user supported grant type(s): `client_credentials`

## HTTP API
This is the traditional request response API which is documented in the [REST API](/docs/category/rest-api) chapter.

Live documentation is also available via Swagger UI (see `/swagger/` URL of your manager) or you can look at the [demo environment Swagger UI](https://demo.openremote.io/swagger/).

Authentication is done using standard `Authorization` header bearer token where the token is a valid access token obtained from the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint.

* Base URL: `/api/{realm}/`
* Authorization Header:  `Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}`

## WS (WebSocket) API
This is a publish subscribe API that is event based, where events are of type [SharedEvent](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/event/shared/SharedEvent.java). Authentication is done using `Authorization` query parameter with a valid access token obtained from the token endpoint. The realm of the authenticating user must also be included as an `Realm` query parameter.

* URL: `/websocket/events?Realm={realm}&Authorization=Bearer%20{accessToken}`
e.g. `wss://localhost:8080/websocket/events?Realm=smartcity&Authorization=Bearer%20eye2238f3a-e43c-3f54-a05a-dd2e4bd4631f`

### Subscriptions
A subscription is created by sending an [EventSubscription](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/event/shared/EventSubscription.java) as `JSON` prefixed with `SUBSCRIBE:`. When a subscribe message is sent then the server will determine if the requesting user is authorised to make such a subscription and if so then the manager will reply with the same subscription `JSON` object but prefixed with `SUBSCRIBED:`, if the user is not authorised then the subscription `JSON` object will be returned but prefixed with `UNAUTHORIZED:`.

When an event occurs in the manager that matches an existing subscription then a [TriggeredEventSubscription](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/event/TriggeredEventSubscription.java) as `JSON` prefixed with `TRIGGERED:` will be sent to the client.

### Publish
[AttributeEvents](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/attribute/AttributeEvent.java) can be published and you can wait for the change to take place and an [AttributeEvent](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/attribute/AttributeEvent.java) to be returned when the attribute does get updated.

It is also possible to emulate the request response nature of the HTTP API in order to read data using the WebSocket API by sending an [EventRequestResponseWrapper](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/event/shared/EventRequestResponseWrapper.java) as `JSON` prefixed with `REQUESTRESPONSE:`, the `messageId` is used to allow the client to associate the request message with the response message. This request response emulation is useful for example to read an asset.

For more details on the structure of messages please refer to the Javadoc of each object type for detailed information.

## MQTT API (MQTT Broker)
Another publish subscribe API, authentication requires a **'Service user'** username and secret and is done using standard `MQTT` username and password mechanism, to connect to the broker:

* Host: Host of the manager (e.g. `demo.openremote.io`)
* Port: 8883 (if running with SSL i.e. the standard stack with reverse SSL proxy) 1883 (if running without SSL proxy)
* Encryption/TLS: true (port 8883) false (port 1883)
* Username: `{realm}:{username}`
* Password: `{secret}`
* ClientId: anything you like (but don't use the same ClientId more than once)

#### Notes
* To create a username and secret be aware that you need to create a 'Service user' (not a regular user). 
* It's important that the `clientId` in the following topics matches the one in the MQTT credentials.

### Subscriptions
#### [AssetEvents](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/asset/AssetEvent.java)
It is possible to subscribe to these events using the topic format:

`{realm}/{clientId}/asset/{assetId}`

Examples:

* `{realm}/{clientId}/asset/#` - All asset events in the realm
* `{realm}/{clientId}/asset/+`- All asset events for direct children of the realm
* `{realm}/{clientId}/asset/{assetId}`- All asset events for the specified asset
* `{realm}/{clientId}/asset/{assetId}/#`- All asset events for descendants of the specified asset
* `{realm}/{clientId}/asset/{assetId}/+`- All asset events for direct children of the specified asset

#### [AttributeEvents](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/attribute/AttributeEvent.java) 
It is possible to subscribe to these events using the topic format:

`{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/{attributeName}/{assetId}`

Examples:

* `{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/+/#` - All attribute events in the realm
* `{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/+/+` - All attribute events for direct children of the realm
* `{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/+/{assetId}`- All attribute events for specified asset
* `{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/{attributeName}/#` - All attribute events for specified attribute name
* `{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/{attributeName}/+` - All attribute events for direct child assets of the realm with specified attribute name
* `{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/{attributeName}/{assetId}`- All attribute events for specified asset with specified attribute name
* `{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/{attributeName}/{assetId}/#`- All attribute events for descendants of the specified asset with specified attribute name
* `{realm}/{clientId}/attribute/{attributeName}/{assetId}/+`- All attribute events for direct children of the specified asset with specified attribute name

:::note

`attributevalue` topic prefix can be used in place of `attribute` to only return the value of the [AttributeEvent](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/attribute/AttributeEvent.java) rather than the entire event.

:::

### Publish
It is possible to publish attribute events to specific assets using the following topic and payload:

* `{realm}/{clientId}/writeattributevalue/{attributeName}/{assetId}` - Payload: `JSON` of attribute value

#### Last will publishing
Clients can configure a last will topic and payload as defined in the MQTT specification; the topic and payload can use the standard attribute publish topic/payload so it is possible to update an attribute when the client connection is closed un-expectedly; the client must have permission to access to the specified attribute.

### MQTT custom handlers
It is possible to inject custom handlers for MQTT messages by implementing the [MQTTHandler](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/manager/src/main/java/org/openremote/manager/mqtt/MQTTHandler.java) abstract class and registering it using the standard Service Loader mechanism (i.e. add it to `resources/META-INF/services/org.openremote.manager.mqtt.MQTTHandler`). The custom handler can choose to intercept messages based on topic, user and/or whether it is a pub or sub request, see Javadoc of `MQTTHandler` for more details.
