# Firmware updating with Hawkbit

OpenRemote integrates with Hawkbit, a framework for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices. Currently we have the following features integrated and tested:
- Running Hawkbit as an extra service (Docker, incl. ARM64)
- Integration of Identity services, so you can use OpenRemote's roles to manage access to Hawkbit
- Tracking firmware versions of edge devices and status of roll-outs

If you are interested in further development and making this available as part of our main branch, please contact us. We can use your help here as it deserves more effort.
