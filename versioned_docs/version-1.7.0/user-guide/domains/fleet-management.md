# Fleet Management

**We have created a [OpenRemote custom project for fleet management](https://github.com/openremote/fleet-management/wiki)** which implements full support for fleet management features, like location tracking and session tracking, and also the industry-first **complete, automatic data recognition** from **any Teltonika Telematics device** model.

Please look at the wiki in that repository for the [tutorial on how to set up your own fleet management system](https://github.com/openremote/fleet-management/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Create-your-own-Fleet-Management-System), and the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/openremote/fleet-management/wiki/Developer-Guide) to understand the inner workings of the fleet management implementation.
