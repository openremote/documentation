# Working on the mobile consoles

The OpenRemote mobile consoles load the web applications using a web view and provide bridging of native device functionality to provide a native app experience.
Make sure you've pulled the latest code of the repository.

## Android Console

Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), then open the [console-android](https://github.com/openremote/console-android) repository.

TODO: There is actually nothing to build right now, you have to create a custom project and a dependency on our Android console project from your own Android app.

## iOS Console

### Developing for iOS is only possible on macOS

Download and install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/xcode/id497799835)

Open Xcode and create a new project.
In the generals part, click on the plus symbol to add a new target.
Select Notification Service Extension.
Close the project.

Install cocoapods through a terminal window.

```shell
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
Navigate to your project directory and create a pod file.

```shell
pod init
```

Open up the Podfile with a text editor and add the `ORLib` pod:

```
workspace '<your_project>'
platform :ios, '14.0'

use_frameworks!

def shared_pods
  pod 'Firebase/Core', '~> 4.6.0'
  pod 'Firebase/Messaging', '~> 4.6.0'
  pod 'Fabric', '~> 1.10.2'
  pod 'Crashlytics', '~> 3.13.4'
  pod 'ORLib', '~> 0.3'
end

target '<your_project>' do
  project '<your_project>'
  shared_pods
end

target 'NotificationService' do
  project '<your_project>'
  shared_pods
end
```

Save and close the Podfile.
In the terminal enter the following command

```shell
pod install
```

A xcworkspace file is created after installing the pod.
Open this file and Xcode will start.

Click on the `Pods` icon in the project tree and then on ORLib in the targets pane.
Search for Require Only App-Extension-Safe API and set it to `No`.
A warning will appear which can be ignored.

Open `AppDelegate` in your project and make it inherit from `ORAppDelegate`.
Remove all the code and override `applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions`.
Set the right project values.

```cpp
override func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        ORServer.hostURL = "example.com"
        ORServer.realm = "example"

        ORAppGroup.entitlement = "group.io.openremote.example"
        
        return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
    }
```

In the `Main.storyboard` add a second ViewController.
The initial viewcontroller should be of class ORLoginViewController.
The other ViewController should be of class ORViewController.

In the Notification Service Extension target, open `NotificationViewController` and make it inherit from `ORNotificationService`.
Remove all the code inside.

When using Firebase, download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` and add it through Xcode.
It shuld be placed in the root of the project.
Make sure that `copy when needed` is checked when adding.

Now your iOS app is setup to work with your OpenRemote project!

## Push Notifications / FCM setup

Our consoles are able to receive push notifications that are sent by the OpenRemote Manager.

Through Firebase, together with the use of FCM tokens, you can set this up for your own project using your own account.

*(steps are unverified)*

### Setup Firebase and client

1. Create a new Firebase Project at https://console.firebase.google.com using either a free or paid plan.
2. When on the 'Project Overview' page, create a new app for your preferred platform; such as Android and iOS.
3. Fill in the correct details for your app, and follow the steps respectively. These should be no different than any other Android/iOS app.

After your config files are placed in the correct folder, (normally `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-info.plist`) and the Firebase Gradle dependencies have been added to your project, you are good to go!

### Configure Manager to send push notifications

To complete the setup process, you should configure the manager to send push notifications to the correct address on Firebase.

> Be sure that the `OR_FIREBASE_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable is set to the correct path.<br />
> Forks of OpenRemote should be correctly configured, but custom projects might need additional attention.<br />
> We normally use `/deployment/manager/fcm.json`.

1. Go to your Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Using the gear icon on the left menu, you can open the 'Project settings'. Open it and go to the 'Service accounts' tab.
3. Generate a new private key for your preferred account; the button will prompt a JSON file download. Store this safely.
4. In your project repository, place the JSON file inside the `/deployment/manager` folder, and rename it to `fcm.json`.

Now you should be set up to send notifications!

You can send these programmatically, or by using the Rules feature in the OpenRemote Manager.

### Encrypt Firebase files in your repository (optional, but recommended)

For most projects, you want to keep Firebase related files secret for security reasons.

We have built-in gradle scripts to help you with this;

1. Open to the `build.gradle` file in the root of your repository.
2. Add/replace the paths specified in the `gradleFileEncrypt` task with the files you want to encrypt.
   Normally this is your `fcm.json` file, but also the files related to the consoles like `google-services.json`.
3. Double check whether these files you want to encrypt are present in your `.gitignore` files. **This is required.**
4. Generate/specify a password to encrypt the files with, by using the `GFE_PASSWORD` environment variable. Save this somewhere safe.
5. Run the `./gradlew encryptFiles` task

You are now set up!

*To decrypt the files again, you can use the `./gradlew decryptFiles` command.*
