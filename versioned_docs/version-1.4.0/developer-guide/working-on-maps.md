# Working on maps

## Vector maps (Mapbox GL)

The manager has built in support for `Mapbox GL` and can serve vector tile data. For this to work please ensure that you have the following files available in the deployment folder:

* `map/mapsettings.json` - Contains settings related to the map tiles source data and also UI rendering settings (e.g. center point of map when first loaded)
* `map/mapdata.mbtiles` - Contains the vector map data (adding it here will override the demo map for Rotterdam, located in the manager folder `src/map`) 

If you have the map data and/or settings in a different location then please ensure that the manager environment variables are set also:
```shell
MAP_TILES_PATH=../deployment/map/mapdata.mbtiles
MAP_SETTINGS_PATH=../deployment/map/mapsettings.json
```

## Raster maps (Mapbox JS)
If you are working on raster maps (Mapbox JS) then you will need to have the `map` Docker container running, this container serves the raster map tiles from the vector map data. 

The container can be started by using the `dev-map.yml` profile (see [here](docker-compose-profiles.md)) or you can add a `map` service to an existing custom project profile (copy the `dev-map.yml` as a template).

The manager acts as a reverse proxy for the `map` service and in order to configure the manager to serve raster tiles you need to set the following environment variables:

```shell
MAP_TILESERVER_HOST=localhost
MAP_TILESERVER_PORT=8082
MAP_TILESERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=10000
```

:::note

By default `MAP_TILESERVER_HOST` is `null` which means the reverse proxy is disabled

## Downloading maps and extracting smaller tilesets
We currently do not have our own pipeline for extracting/converting OSM data into vector tilesets but depend on the extracts offered on [openmaptiles.org](https://openmaptiles.com/downloads/). You can download the vector `mbtiles` file that contains the bounding box of interest.

From that mbtiles file you can extract smaller tilesets with the following procedure:

1. Rename the source tileset file `input.mbtiles`
1. Create Docker container with `node` and `python` with dir containing `input.mbtiles` volume mapped: `docker run -it --rm -v PATH_TO_INPUT_MBTILES_DIR:/mapdata nikolaik/python-nodejs:python3.8-nodejs12 bash`
1. Install tilelive converter: 
    `npm install -g --unsafe @mapbox/mbtiles @mapbox/tilelive`
1. Select and copy boundary box coordinates of desired region (these are the BOUNDS used in the next command; they must be in format [W,S,E,N] e.g. `4.91, 51.27, 5.84, 51.77`): 
    https://tools.geofabrik.de/calc/#tab=1 (use the coordinates in 'Simple Copy' and add the commas)
1. Extract the desired region (adjust the zoom levels as required and optionally add `--timeout=Nms` if the task times out): `tilelive-copy --minzoom=0 --maxzoom=14 --bounds="FILL_BOUNDS_HERE" /mapdata/input.mbtiles /mapdata/output.mbtiles`
1. Rename `output.mbtiles` into `mapdata.mbtiles`
