# Configuring the Manager UI

The settings option 'Appearance' can be used in a [custom deployment](custom-deployment.md). You can use it to style your deployment and configure how the pages of the Manager display the assets and attributes in your system. Some of these settings can be changed visually in the user interface, others can be set when selecting the JSON editor. The configuration gets stored in the manager_config file.

See [Manager UI - Appearance](../manager-ui/appearance) on how to configure the manager appearance.
